# Couch
James + Hugo Part 4 Project

Couch is a music streaming application designed to emulate the experience of sitting on the couch listening to music with your friends... no matter where you are in the world. Groups of friends are able to collaboratively manage a single shared playlist which streams the audio to all clients simultaneously. The main web frameworks and technologies used for this project included Firebase, PostgreSQL, Flask, AngularJS, and Rdio's streaming API.

On the 22nd of December in 2015, Rdio's streaming service was shutdown after being acquired by Pandora Radio. This was the main source of music for Couch. Due to this, Couch is going to require some refactoring before being able to be used again :(

RIP Rdio.
